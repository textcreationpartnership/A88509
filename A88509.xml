            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the moſt ſacred and holy Word of God, (which is written for our inſtruction; in which (by the merits of Jeſus Chriſt) depends our ſalvation, by reading, hearing, and preaching) And in this holy Scripture, the perfect Creation of the World is ſet down, in the true and largeſt mannner; as you may read, in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> pen'd by the faithfull hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was in the place of a King, Prieſt, and Prophet, to the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> In which Chapter, by reading or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, you ſhall find proved poſitively, how the Omnipotent God, great JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, the Lord of lords, and King of kings, whoſe power has no end, whoſe glory is unſpeakable, whoſe mercy is infinite, whoſe goodneſſe cannot be numbered, nor his bleſſings parallel'd:
<pb facs="tcp:170583:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 85 -->He who rideth on the skies, and makes the earth his footſtool; that is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the ending. It was this good God, that firſt fram'd this Univerſe; It was the Lords work, and the Lords will, that created this world: It was the glorious almighty power of Heaven, that firſt founded this fabrick; it was God that made of nothing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and it was the Lord that made the Sun to govern the day, and the Moon to govern the night; it was the Lord of Hoſts that made the great Whales, and all the fiſhes ſwimming in the waters; and it was the great God of our ſalvation, that made every living creature. And was it not the Lords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent power, to make man according to his own Image, pure, juſt, and holy; yea, in the State of all bleſſed felicity. But how ſoon, through tranſgreſſion, did man remove himſelf from that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py paradice, that heavenly manſion, that portion of joy, which he ſo ſoon ſpent, like the prodigall ſon: read the 15 Chapter of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell.</p>

The fall of <hi>Adam</hi> has been our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, for we by his ſins, as heirs from his loines, are all dead in ſins and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Nevertheleſſe, we are all made whole by the ſecond <hi>Adam; For as the Serpent was lift up in the Wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Son of man be lift up, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> The 3d.

This place of holy Scripture does manifeſtly prove, by the mouth of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that whoſoever believes in him ſhall be ſaved. But on the contrary, thoſe that deny Chriſt, and have crucified our bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, will deny them before his Father which is in heaven.</p>
            <p>It is through unbelief, that we have ſuch ſtrange apparitions in the aire, where has been the appearance of four Suns altogether, the Moon has been ſeen as red as blood, ſtrange kinde of hail and rain, great winds and earth-quakes, moſt horrible and terrible thunder in the midſt of winter, to the great frights

            <head>A Briefe Relation of a Great Whale that was Kill'd neere Green-wich.</head>
            <p>UPon the third of <hi>June</hi> this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year 1658. a huge whale came ſwimming up the Thames and was firſt ſeen by a boy at black-Wall being of a mighty bulke and bigneſs, which ſomething frighted the boy to ſee ſuch a Monſtrous fiſh: the boy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently revealed it to ſome Water-men thereabouts, who inſtantly got Harping-irons: Spits, Hatchets, Bills and Axes, &amp; fell a ſtriking the Whale as far as they durſt venter. The Water-men ſtripping off their Doublets and Breeches, and went only in their Shirts and Drawers to be light and nimble at their worke;
<pb facs="tcp:170583:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 87 -->and to eſcape the danger of drowning in caſe the Whale had over-turn'd them, they ſtruck the Harping-irons all at one time into her body, but ſhe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remov'd them out again.</p>
            <p>Some ſtabb'd ſpits into her, and the Maſter of the haye that lives at the three Flower-deluces in Greenwich, ſhot a brace of bullets into her; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the bloud ſpouted out of her body, as if ſome had pompt her, they were half affraid that ſhe would get from them; the vehemency of her Wounds made her diſgorge the water out of her mouth in a bundance, that the people there preſent were amazed to ſee it, and although the tide was very ſtrong and the wind againſt her, ſhe hauld the boats at her pleaſure, for they ſtuck Ankers into her body with ſpits &amp; irons; and ſhe removed them as faſt as they ſtruck her, till at laſt a Fiſher-man threw a little Anker, which got into one of her noſtrills, and ſtuck ſo faſt that ſhe could not remove it, and whilſt ſhe was in this extaſie and danger of
<pb facs="tcp:170583:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 87 -->death ſhe would ſometimes bounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water as high as a houſe, and down ſhe would ſinck into the Thames again, then up again leaping and toſſing her body above the water, ſometimes eight or nine foot high; all this while the Sea-men, Water-men, and Ship Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters waited their opportunities to ſtrike the harping irons into her, which upon all occaſions they did with much vigellency, care and induſtry; and by wounding of the Whale ſo often, and ſo much, the water that the place contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereabouts, for at leaſt twenty yards round, was like a pond of bloud, and thoſe that were neer her, and at her execution were beſmeared with blond as if they had been in a ſlaughter houſe, there was ſuch running and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the people both to ſee and hear of the deſtroying of this Whale, as is almoſt increadible; divers of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and worthy Cittizens went thither in their Coaches, and abundance from Weſtminiſter, London, and the burrow of South-wark repair'd both by Land
<pb facs="tcp:170583:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 88 -->and Water to ſee this Fiſh of Wonder, and the Water-men and others made a priſe of her; for, they took two-pence a piece of all the ſpectatours, ſo it prov'd a gallant day of <hi>Jubillie</hi> to the Water-men, which is according to the old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is an ill wind that blows no body profit, at laſt two Ankers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the fiſhers, was ſtruck faſt into the body of the VVhale, which was the cauſe of her death; and when the people perceiv'd that her breath was departed, they unanimouſly (with a great ſhout leap'd upon the back of the VVhale, and fell to cutting of her up with axes, hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, bills, and other ſharp inſtruments for the ſame purpoſe, and it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that a little before her death ſhe gave moſt grievious, deadly, doleful and heavy groans, that by the report of the people that both ſaw and heard it, they never heard of the like before. It had Crab-lice ſticking upon the body of it, that were as big as a ſpider, then as they were a deviding the body into ſeverall peeces by chopping of it with
<pb facs="tcp:170583:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 88 -->hatchets and the like they made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Some bought peeces as big as a mans middle, and ſome took leſſer peeces to ſhew to their neighbors, friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that what is reported con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this hugeous whaile, is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute truth; and as a monument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, they do both ſafely and ſecurely lock it up, eſteeming more rarely of it, then a diſh of Anchovis, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Lobſters, that is a preſent for a Lady, for although a whale be not good to eate, it is novelty, and very ſtrange and much more ſtranger to be catcht in the River of Thames ſo neere to London bridge. The Cronicles do ſpecify, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall great fiſhes, have come at ſome remarkable times at the diſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, to the wonder and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many people then living, which ſtrange concourſe of nature with thoſe great fiſhes, have bin as a ſigne of ſome dangers approaching, but this was one ſpeciall favour of providence, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the killing of this whale there
<pb facs="tcp:170583:7"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 89 -->was abundance of men women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſome of them at ſometimes were very neer her, and yet none of them had ſo much hurt done them as the fillip of a finger. The company that was her Executioners, and at her death did meaſure her, and found the vaſt length of the whale to be full eight and fifty foot, and ſhe was compleat 12 foot high, ſhe was 14 foot in bredth, and two foot long between the eyes; ſhe had very large noſtrills, and a hugeous wide mouth, and in one of her noſtrills an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker being caſt, was one of the mane cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her death, ſhe ſtared with her eyes moſt ſtrangely, and was at leaſt ſix hours a killing, out at laſt the whale was made there priſe, and the water men gaind the conqueſt.</p>
            <p>But certainly I cannot conceive to the contrary, but that this whale (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus contrary to cuſtom) is ſome ſigne or token of heavens diſpleaſure, for it is the judgment of the men of art, that ſtrange things produecs ſtrange affects now whether we gave credit to there
